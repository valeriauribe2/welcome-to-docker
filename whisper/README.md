You're trying to build a Docker image from the current directory (`.`) and 
tag it as `openai-whisper`. Here's what you can expect:

1. **Dockerfile**: Make sure there is a file named `Dockerfile` in your 
current working directory. This file contains the instructions for 
building the Docker image.
2. **Build process**: The `docker build` command will:
	* Read the instructions from the `Dockerfile`.
	* Create a new Docker image with the specified tag (`openai-whisper`).
	* Execute each instruction in the `Dockerfile`, which may include:
		+ Copying files from your local machine to the container.
		+ Installing dependencies (e.g., Python packages).
		+ Running commands or scripts.
3. **Image creation**: The build process will create a new Docker image 
and store it on your local machine.

If everything goes smoothly, you should see an output like this:
```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB
Step 1/2 : FROM python:3.13-slim
 ---> 7b44ac69c2ce
Step 2/2 : COPY . /app
 ---> e7a9b0a8e4f5
Successfully built e7a9b0a8e4f5
Successfully tagged openai-whisper:latest
```
This indicates that the build process was successful, and you now have a 
Docker image with the tag `openai-whisper` and the latest version.

Remember to run `docker images` or `docker ls` to verify that the image 
has been created and is available for use.



------------
A daemon, in this context, refers to a background process that runs 
continuously, performing tasks without user intervention. To run a daemon 
from your Docker image, you'll need to:

1. **Create a script**: Write a shell script (e.g., `run-daemon.sh`) that 
contains the commands needed to run your daemon.
2. **Copy the script to the container**: In your `Dockerfile`, copy the 
script file into the container using the `COPY` instruction:
```dockerfile
COPY run-daemon.sh /app/run-daemon.sh
```
3. **Make the script executable**: Use the `RUN` instruction to make the 
script executable:
```dockerfile
RUN chmod +x /app/run-daemon.sh
```
4. **Run the daemon script as a background process**: Use the `CMD` 
instruction to run the script as a background process:
```dockerfile
CMD ["/app/run-daemon.sh", "&"]
```
The `&` at the end of the command tells the shell to run the command in 
the background.

Here's an example `Dockerfile` snippet:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim

COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt

COPY run-daemon.sh /app/run-daemon.sh
RUN chmod +x /app/run-daemon.sh

CMD ["/app/run-daemon.sh", "&"]
```
In this example, the `run-daemon.sh` script is assumed to be responsible 
for running your daemon. You'll need to modify the script to contain the 
necessary commands to run your daemon.

Once you've built and tagged your Docker image, you can start a container 
from it using:
```bash
docker run -d --name my-container openai-whisper
```
The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode (i.e., background). The 
`--name` flag assigns a name to the container.
